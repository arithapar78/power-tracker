## Recent Changes and Decisions

### Major Architectural Decisions

#### 1. Watts-Based Measurement System
**Decision**: Migrated from abstract "energy scores" to real watts-based measurements
**Rationale**: 
- Provides meaningful, actionable data users can understand
- Enables real-world comparisons (LED bulbs, CO2 emissions)
- Aligns with actual power consumption research
- Supports environmental impact calculations

**Implementation Status**: Complete with migration system

#### 2. AI Energy Tracking Integration  
**Decision**: Added comprehensive backend AI model energy tracking
**Rationale**:
- AI tools represent the fastest-growing energy consumption category
- Users are completely unaware of backend processing energy costs  
- Prompt optimization can achieve significant energy savings
- Positions extension as leader in AI energy optimization

**Implementation Status**: Fully integrated with access control

#### 3. Deterministic Agent System
**Decision**: Build intelligent optimization without external AI dependencies
**Rationale**:
- Ensures privacy (no external API calls)
- Maintains consistent performance regardless of network
- Reduces extension's own energy consumption
- Provides enterprise-grade reliability

**Implementation Status**: Core framework complete, optimization strategies active

### Recent Technical Improvements

#### Enhanced Error Handling and Reliability
- **Exponential Backoff**: Sophisticated retry logic with jitter to prevent thundering herd
- **Context Validation**: Comprehensive checks for extension context validity
- **Graceful Degradation**: System functions even when components fail to load
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Automatic recovery from service worker restarts

#### Progressive Enhancement Architecture
- **Conditional Feature Loading**: Advanced features load only when available
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Core functionality always works regardless of feature availability
- **Runtime Adaptation**: System adapts to available components dynamically
- **User Experience Continuity**: Seamless experience regardless of loaded features

## Active Development Patterns

### Code Organization Principles

#### 1. Progressive Enhancement Pattern
```javascript
// Feature availability detection
if (AGENT_SYSTEM_AVAILABLE && typeof EnergyTrackerWithAgent !== 'undefined') {
  tracker = new EnergyTrackerWithAgent();
} else {
  tracker = new EnergyTracker(); // Fallback
}
```
**Rationale**: Ensures extension works for all users while providing enhanced features when available

#### 2. Safety-First Data Operations
```javascript
// All data operations include safety measures
await this.createSafetyBackup(backupKey);
try {
  await this.performOperation();
} catch (error) {
  await this.restoreFromBackup(backupKey);
  throw error;
}
```
**Rationale**: User data protection is paramount - never risk data loss

#### 3. Intelligent Caching Strategy
```javascript
// Multiple cache levels for performance
this.lastMetrics = {}; // Immediate cache
this.patterns = new Map(); // Pattern cache with LRU eviction  
this.behaviorData = new Map(); // Time-windowed behavioral data
```
**Rationale**: Minimize redundant calculations while respecting memory constraints

### User Experience Priorities

#### 1. Invisible Until Needed
- Extension operates transparently until user needs information
- Notifications appear only when genuinely helpful
- Advanced features discoverable but not intrusive
- Performance impact undetectable during normal browsing

#### 2. Progressive Disclosure
- Basic users see simple power numbers and tips
- Intermediate users access historical data and settings
- Advanced users unlock AI optimization and analytics tools
- Expert users get full control over agent behavior and rules

#### 3. User Agency Respect
- All optimizations require explicit or learned consent
- Users maintain full control over their browsing experience
- Clear explanation of what each optimization does
- Easy override and customization of all automated behavior

## Current Technical Challenges

### 1. Chrome Manifest V3 Limitations
**Challenge**: Service worker lifecycle management and memory constraints
**Current Approach**: 
- Robust restart recovery mechanisms
- State persistence strategies
- Minimal memory footprint optimization
- Efficient data structure usage

**Status**: Well-handled with comprehensive testing

### 2. Power Measurement Accuracy
**Challenge**: Browser APIs don't directly expose power consumption
**Current Approach**:
- Research-based calculation algorithms
- Multi-factor power estimation (DOM, CPU, network, media)
- Confidence scoring for accuracy indication
- Continuous calibration against real-world measurements

**Status**: Achieving Â±10% accuracy in most scenarios

### 3. AI Model Energy Estimation
**Challenge**: Backend AI processing energy is not directly observable
**Current Approach**:
- Model-specific energy profiles based on research data
- Context-aware usage estimation
- Real-time adjustment based on user patterns
- Conservative estimates to avoid underestimating impact

**Status**: Providing meaningful estimates with clear uncertainty indicators

## Learnings and Insights

### User Behavior Patterns

#### 1. Energy Awareness Journey
**Insight**: Users go through predictable stages of energy awareness
- **Discovery**: Surprise at actual energy consumption levels
- **Learning**: Understanding which activities consume most energy
- **Optimization**: Actively seeking ways to reduce consumption
- **Mastery**: Using advanced features for comprehensive optimization

**Application**: UI design supports each stage with appropriate complexity level

#### 2. Notification Effectiveness
**Insight**: Contextual, actionable notifications drive behavior change
- Generic "high energy" alerts are largely ignored
- Specific actions ("pause this video to save 8W") get engagement
- Real-world comparisons ("like 3 LED bulbs") create emotional connection
- Achievement notifications reinforce positive behavior

**Application**: Sophisticated notification system with contextual targeting

#### 3. Feature Adoption Patterns  
**Insight**: Advanced features require discovery mechanisms
- Lightning bolt icon for advanced features increases discoverability
- Access code creates perceived value and reduces support burden
- Progressive feature unlocking maintains engagement

**Application**: Careful feature revelation and access control design

### Technical Architecture Lessons

#### 1. Dependency Management
**Learning**: Optional dependencies with fallbacks create robust systems
- Core functionality should never depend on optional components
- Enhanced features should degrade gracefully
- Runtime feature detection enables progressive enhancement
- Clear separation between core and advanced features

#### 2. Data Migration Strategy
**Learning**: User trust requires bulletproof data migration
- Always create backups before any data transformation
- Provide clear rollback mechanisms
- Communicate migration status transparently
- Test migration paths extensively before release

#### 3. Extension Ecosystem Integration  
**Learning**: Chrome Web Store success requires conflict-free operation
- Namespace pollution is the primary conflict source
- Message type prefixing prevents handler conflicts
- Storage key prefixing prevents data corruption
- CSS scoping prevents style conflicts

- B2B sales model very different from consumer
**Current Stance**: Monitor user feedback, consider for future major version

#### 2. Cross-Browser Support
**Question**: Should we port to Firefox/Safari?
**Considerations**:
- Different WebExtensions implementations require significant work
- Market share and user demand unclear
- Resource allocation vs Chrome feature development
**Current Stance**: Chrome-first strategy with monitoring of other platforms

#### 3. External API Integration
**Question**: Should we integrate with carbon footprint tracking services?
**Considerations**:
- Would provide more accurate environmental impact data
- Contradicts privacy-first approach
- Creates external dependencies and failure points
**Current Stance**: Maintain local-only approach, consider optional integration

### Quality and Reliability Focus
