});
```

## Development and Extension

### Adding Custom Rules

```javascript
// In rule-engine.js, add to initializeRules()
this.addRule('custom_optimization', {
  priority: 5,
  condition: (state, context) => {
    // Your condition logic
    return state.customMetric > threshold;
  },
  action: 'customAction',
  description: 'Custom optimization rule',
  energySaving: 15,
  userImpact: 'low'
});
```

### Creating Custom Actions

```javascript
// In intelligent-actions.js, add to initializeActions()
this.registerAction('customAction', {
  handler: this.executeCustomAction.bind(this),
  energySaving: 15,
  riskLevel: 'low',
  executionTime: 'fast',
  description: 'Execute custom optimization'
});
```

### Extending Pattern Recognition

```javascript
// Add custom pattern detector
class CustomPatternDetector {
  async detect(dataStream) {
    // Your pattern detection logic
    return patterns;
  }
}

// Register in pattern-recognition-system.js
this.customDetector = new CustomPatternDetector();
```

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy

- User patterns stored locally with Chrome storage API
- Automatic cleanup of old data

### Permissions
- Requires standard Chrome extension permissions
- Tab access for energy monitoring
- Storage access for learning and patterns
- No additional network permissions needed

### Safety Measures
- Rate limiting prevents excessive optimization
