# Project Brief - Power Tracker Chrome Extension

## Core Mission
Power Tracker is a sophisticated Chrome extension that transforms browser energy consumption monitoring from a passive observation into an intelligent, actionable optimization system. It provides real-time power consumption tracking in watts while employing AI-powered optimization to reduce energy usage and environmental impact.

## Primary Objectives

### 1. Real-Time Power Monitoring
- Monitor browser power consumption with watts-based measurements
- Track energy usage across all open tabs and browser activities
- Provide accurate power consumption data using research-based algorithms

### 2. Intelligent Energy Optimization
- Deploy AI-powered energy agent system for automatic optimization
- Use deterministic algorithms for intelligent decision-making
- Implement rule-based optimization strategies without external AI dependencies

### 3. Advanced AI Model Integration
- Monitor and optimize AI model energy consumption (backend power tracking)
- Provide prompt optimization tools to reduce AI query energy usage
- Support multiple AI platforms (GPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)

### 4. Environmental Impact Awareness
- Calculate and display real-world environmental comparisons
- Show CO2 emissions, water usage, and energy cost implications
- Encourage energy-efficient browsing behaviors

### 5. User Experience Excellence
- Provide intuitive popup interface with glassmorphism design
- Offer contextual in-page energy tips and notifications
- Support both light and dark themes with accessibility features

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- **Environmentally Conscious Users**: Individuals wanting to minimize their digital carbon footprint
