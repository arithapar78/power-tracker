# Product Context - Power Tracker Chrome Extension

## Why This Project Exists

### The Growing Digital Energy Crisis
Modern web browsing has evolved into an energy-intensive activity. With billions of users running multiple browser tabs, streaming videos, using AI tools, and engaging with complex web applications, the collective energy consumption of web browsing has reached unprecedented levels. A typical browser session can consume 15-65 watts, equivalent to running multiple LED bulbs continuously.

### The AI Revolution's Energy Impact
The rapid adoption of AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) has introduced a new category of high-energy browser usage. AI model queries can consume 10-100x more energy than traditional web requests, but users remain completely unaware of this impact. Backend AI processing can add 20-80 watts to browser energy consumption.

### Lack of Energy Awareness
Users have no visibility into their browser's energy consumption. Unlike mobile devices with battery indicators, desktop browser energy usage is invisible, leading to unconscious waste and environmental impact.

## Problems We Solve

### Primary Problems

#### 1. Energy Consumption Invisibility
**Problem**: Users cannot see or measure their browser's power consumption in real-time.
**Impact**: Leads to unconscious energy waste, increased electricity bills, and environmental harm.
**Our Solution**: Real-time watts-based power measurement with accurate, research-backed algorithms.

#### 2. AI Energy Usage Blindness  
**Problem**: AI tool users are unaware that their prompts and queries consume significant backend energy.
**Impact**: Heavy AI users can unknowingly consume 50-200W of backend processing power.
**Our Solution**: Backend AI energy tracking with prompt optimization tools that reduce consumption by 15-45%.

#### 3. Lack of Actionable Optimization
**Problem**: Even when users are aware of high energy usage, they don't know how to optimize it.
**Impact**: Continued wasteful browsing patterns and missed savings opportunities.
**Our Solution**: Intelligent energy agent system that provides automated optimization with user consent.

#### 4. Environmental Impact Disconnection
**Problem**: Abstract energy numbers don't connect to real-world environmental impact.
**Impact**: Users don't understand the broader implications of their digital behavior.
**Our Solution**: Real-world comparisons (LED bulbs, CO2 emissions, water usage) that make impact tangible.

### Secondary Problems

#### Tab Management Chaos
Many users keep dozens of tabs open, creating energy drain without awareness of which tabs consume the most power.

#### Video and Media Overconsumption
Auto-playing videos and media-rich sites consume disproportionate energy, but users lack guidance on optimization.

#### Extension Conflict and Integration
Most optimization tools conflict with existing workflows or compete with other extensions.

## User Experience Goals

### Primary UX Goals

#### 1. Effortless Awareness
Users should gain energy awareness without changing their browsing behavior. The extension should feel like a natural part of the browser, not an additional burden.

#### 2. Actionable Intelligence
Every notification and recommendation should provide clear, specific actions users can take to improve their energy efficiency.

#### 3. Respect User Agency
All optimizations require user consent. The system should suggest, not dictate. Users maintain full control over their browsing experience.

#### 4. Progressive Disclosure
Basic users see simple power numbers and tips. Advanced users can access detailed analytics, AI optimization tools, and comprehensive settings.

### Secondary UX Goals

#### Aesthetic Excellence
Beautiful, modern interface that users enjoy interacting with. Glassmorphism design creates premium feel while maintaining readability.

#### Performance First
Zero impact on browsing performance. The optimization tool should never slow down the browser it's trying to optimize.

#### Accessibility Compliance
Full support for screen readers, keyboard navigation, and vision accessibility requirements.

#### Cross-Device Consistency
Consistent experience across desktop form factors, with responsive design for different screen sizes.

### User Emotional Journey

#### Discovery Phase
- **Curiosity**: "How much energy does my browsing really use?"
- **Surprise**: "I didn't know YouTube consumed 35 watts!"
